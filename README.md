# VetsGroupWebsite
The VetsGroup is a non-profit organization aimed towards supporting veterans primarily through
job placement assistance, certification training, and counseling. We have decided to make the
VetsGroup website open source for both professional collaboration as well as to be used as a 
student reference. This application is not designed to be configuration nor deployable to other
organizations.
